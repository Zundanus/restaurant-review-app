# Mobile Web Restaurant Reviews app
---
##  Description

This app is part of the Udacity Project for the completion of the Froned Web Development Nanodegree. The app is developed using HTML, CSS and pure JavaScript.


## Project Overview

The **Restaurant Reviews** projects, was trasformd from a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. To achive this, I changed the static design, the lacks of accessibility and convert the design to be responsive. I also add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for the users.

### What do I do from here?

1. Open the main project folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.

    * In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
   * Note -  For Windows systems, Python 3.x is installed as `python` by default. To start a Python 3.x server, you can simply enter `python -m http.server 8000`.
2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.
3. Explore the provided code, and start making a plan to implement the required features in three areas: responsive design, accessibility and offline use.
4. Write code to implement the updates to get this site on its way to being a mobile-ready website.
